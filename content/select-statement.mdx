## Selecting Between Channels

The `select` statement is like a `switch` for channels. It blocks until one of its cases can proceed, then executes that case. If multiple are ready, it picks one at random.

```go
select {
case v := <-ch1:
    fmt.Println("received from ch1:", v)
case v := <-ch2:
    fmt.Println("received from ch2:", v)
}
```

## The Default Case

Adding `default` makes `select` non-blocking. If no channel is ready, `default` runs immediately — useful for polling without blocking.

## Timeout Pattern

`time.After(d)` returns a channel that receives a value after duration `d`. Combined with `select`, this implements cancellable waits without a timer struct.

## Done Channel Pattern

A `done` channel signals goroutines to stop. When the parent closes or sends to `done`, all goroutines watching it with `select` can exit cleanly.

## Fan-In Pattern

Fan-in merges multiple input channels into a single output channel. Each input gets its own goroutine that forwards values. `select` picks whichever is ready.
