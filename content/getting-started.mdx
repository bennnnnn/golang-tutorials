## What is Go?

Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was designed to be simple, fast, and reliable — perfect for building modern backend systems, CLI tools, and cloud infrastructure.

**Why learn Go?**
- **Simple syntax** — only 25 keywords, easy to read and write
- **Fast compilation** — compiles to native machine code in seconds
- **Built-in concurrency** — goroutines and channels make concurrent programming easy
- **Strong standard library** — HTTP servers, JSON, cryptography, testing, and more out of the box
- **Single binary deployment** — compile once, copy anywhere, no dependencies needed
- **Used by top companies** — Google, Docker, Kubernetes, Uber, Twitch, Cloudflare, and many more

## Installing Go

Visit [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) and download the installer for your operating system:

- **macOS:** Download the `.pkg` installer and run it
- **Windows:** Download the `.msi` installer and run it
- **Linux:** Download the tarball and extract to `/usr/local`:

```bash
# Linux only
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

After installation, open your terminal and verify Go is installed:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output like `go version go1.22.0 darwin/arm64`. If you see `command not found`, restart your terminal or check that Go's bin directory is in your `PATH`.

Also check that the Go toolchain is working:

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

This shows where Go stores downloaded packages. By default it's `~/go` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\go` on Windows.

## Setting Up VS Code

Visual Studio Code is the most popular editor for Go. Here's how to set it up:

**1. Install VS Code** from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.

**2. Install the Go extension:**
- Open VS Code
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac) to open Extensions
- Search for **"Go"** by the Go team at Google
- Click **Install**

**3. Install Go tools:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette
- Type **"Go: Install/Update Tools"**
- Select **all tools** and click OK

This installs `gopls` (the Go language server for autocomplete and navigation), `dlv` (the debugger), `staticcheck` (a linter), and other helpful tools.

**4. Verify it works:**
- Create any `.go` file in VS Code
- You should see syntax highlighting, auto-imports, and error checking working immediately

> **Tip:** Enable "Format on Save" in VS Code settings. The Go extension will automatically format your code using `gofmt` every time you save, keeping your code clean and consistent.

## Setting Up Your First Project

Every Go project starts with a **module**. A module is Go's way of managing a project and its dependencies. Create a project folder and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir my-first-go-app
cd my-first-go-app
go mod init my-first-go-app
```

This creates a `go.mod` file in your project directory. Think of it like `package.json` in JavaScript or `requirements.txt` in Python — it tracks your project name and any external dependencies.

The `go.mod` file looks like this:

```text
module my-first-go-app

go 1.22
```

## Understanding `package main` and `func main()`

Before writing code, let's understand two fundamental concepts that every Go program needs.

**`package main`** — Every Go file belongs to a package. The `main` package is special — it tells the Go compiler "this is an executable program, not a reusable library." Without `package main`, Go won't know where to start your program.

**`func main()`** — This is the **entry point** of your program. When you run `go run main.go`, Go looks for a function called `main` inside `package main` and starts executing there. Every executable Go program must have exactly one `main` function.

Think of it like the `main()` in C/Java, or like how a Python script runs from the top of the file — except Go explicitly requires this function.

---

## Your First Go Program: Hello World

Create a file called `main.go` in your project folder and add this code:

```gorun
// hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Click **Run** above to see the output! Let's break down every line:

### Line 1: `package main`
Declares this file as part of the `main` package — making it an executable program.

### Line 3: `import "fmt"`
Imports the `fmt` (format) package from Go's standard library. This package provides functions for formatted I/O — printing to the terminal, formatting strings, and reading input.

### Line 5: `func main()`
Defines the main function — Go starts executing your program here. The curly braces `{}` define the function body.

### Line 6: `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`
`Println` means "print line" — it prints the text to the terminal and adds a newline character at the end. The `fmt.` prefix tells Go this function comes from the `fmt` package.

---

## Printing and Formatting Output

Go's `fmt` package gives you several ways to output text:

```gorun
// printing.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Println adds a newline at the end
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gopher!")
    fmt.Println("This is on a new line")

    // Print does NOT add a newline
    fmt.Print("Hello ")
    fmt.Print("World")
    fmt.Print("\n") // manually add newline

    // Printf lets you format with placeholders ("verbs")
    name := "Go"
    version := 1.22
    fmt.Printf("Learning %s version %.2f\n", name, version)

    // Sprintf returns a formatted string (doesn't print it)
    message := fmt.Sprintf("I love %s!", name)
    fmt.Println(message)
}
```

**Quick summary:**
- `fmt.Println()` — prints with a newline at the end
- `fmt.Print()` — prints without a newline
- `fmt.Printf()` — prints with format placeholders (we'll cover format verbs in detail in the next tutorial)
- `fmt.Sprintf()` — like Printf but returns a string instead of printing

## Comments in Go

Comments explain your code to other developers (and your future self). The compiler ignores them completely:

```gorun
// comments.go
package main

import "fmt"

// This is a single-line comment — starts with //

/*
   This is a multi-line comment.
   It starts with /* and ends with */
   Great for longer explanations or temporarily
   disabling blocks of code.
*/

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Comments are ignored by the compiler")
    fmt.Println("They only exist to help humans") // inline comment
}
```

> **Go convention:** Use `//` comments above functions to document what they do. Tools like `go doc` and VS Code will pick these up and show them as documentation.

## Running Go Programs

There are two ways to run Go code from the terminal:

### `go run` — compile and run in one step

Best for development — compiles your code to a temporary location and runs it immediately:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You can also run all `.go` files in the current directory:

```bash
go run .
```

### `go build` — compile to a binary

Creates a standalone executable file you can distribute and deploy:

```bash
go build -o myapp main.go
./myapp
```

The resulting binary includes **everything** needed to run — no Go installation, no dependencies, no runtime required on the target machine. This is one of Go's biggest advantages for deployment.

> **Tip:** During development, use `go run`. When you're ready to deploy or share your program, use `go build`.

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

Here are some things that will trip you up early on:

**1. Unused imports cause compile errors:**
```go
import "fmt" // ERROR if you don't use fmt anywhere
```
Go refuses to compile if you import a package but don't use it. This keeps your code clean.

**2. Unused variables cause compile errors:**
```go
x := 5 // ERROR if you never use x
```
Same rule — Go won't compile if you declare a variable and never use it.

**3. Braces must be on the same line:**
```go
// ✅ Correct
func main() {
}

// ❌ Wrong — won't compile!
func main()
{
}
```
Go's automatic semicolon insertion requires the opening brace on the same line as the function declaration.
